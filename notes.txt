- Adopting a context-focused approach, however, goes against the grain of current
  philanthropic practice. ... Instead, companies are often distracted by the desire to
  publicize how much money and effort they are contributing in order to foster an

  on improving context. ... The most successful programs will not be short-term campaigns
  but long-term commitments that continue to grow in scale and sophistication.
